# Sign-Language-Interpreter-for-The-Hearing-Speaking-Impaired  

## Overview  
This project aims to develop a **real-time sign language interpreter** using:  
- **Flex and accelerometer sensors** integrated with an **ESP32 board**.  
- **Machine learning algorithms** to classify gestures and translate them into Readable outputs.   
- A solution enabling seamless communication for hearing and speech-impaired individuals.  

## Features  
- **Real-time gesture recognition** using flex and accelerometer sensors.  
- **Compact and portable** design.  
- Operates **offline**, ensuring accessibility anywhere.  
- **Cost-effective** solution for sign language interpretation.  
- **Customizable** for different sign languages.  
- **Accurate recognition** in diverse environmental conditions.
